Efynch.com is a bidding platform for homeowners to put their work online and have contractors bid for their work. This company is was created by Teris Panteza, Charles Paul, and myself. The company is based in Baltimore, MD and serves customers currently in that area. Currently we have gained an estimated 3,000 users and under going pitches to angel investors to grow the company. This application is also available on the App Store and Play Store for mobile devices.

My role for the project was CTO. I was responsible for creating a proof of concept along with the the API and payment gateway system so that we would be able to pitch the idea to angel investors to show that it would work and it would generate profit. I built the system as a web application using PHP Codeigniter, Apache, and MySQL on a Linux Server. Once we we were ready to roll out the system, we hired a developers and designers to update the system and help me with the load of work while I continue to go to school at UH.

This project taught me a lot about development for a startup. I learned that one very important skill all developers should have is to adapt to the situation you are in. Taking on a big project such as this has also helped me to learn to work with others so that the overall project can be done in an efficient manner. Since this project has also been an entrepreneurship experience, I have also learned the hard work needed to start a business.
